(referred to hereinafter as the  said   company) to   effect  the   sale  of   Sodium Hydrosulphite manufactured  by the  said company in the area covered by  the Kerala State under an agreement entered into on  11th   February,  1967.\nThe  dispute  pertains  to  the transactions which  took place between 1st  September, 1967 and 20th  December, 1968  since it is an undisputed that the transactions upto  the former  date are  not taxable.\nIt is common ground  that the  relations between  the parties were governed throughout  by the  said  agreement  and  that  the parties adhered  to the terms of the said agreement.\nIn view of this  it would  be desirable to examine that agreement at this stage.\nAs  aforesaid,  the  agreement  is  dated 11th February, 1967.\nUnder the  agreement, the assessee firm was appointed  as Distributor  for   the  aforesaid   product manufactured by  the company  for the  area covered  by  the Kerala State.\nclause use use 2  of the  agreement provides that the distributorship  was   on  an  exclusive  basis  giving  the distributor the  right of  sale of  the product  within  the aforementioned area  and that  supplies would  be made only direct to  the distributor,  Sub  clause use    of  clause use  2 further provides\n   882    However, when  on the  advice of  the distributor    bulk supplies  are  effected  in  waggon-load  or    lorry-load lots  the Company may effect  supplies    direct  to   the  consumer, provided  that  the    distributor arranges the payment as per the clause use    hereinafter mentioned   and   also  takes  the    responsibility  to  bear  entirely  the  resultant    effects  and risks  from  effecting such  direct    despatches.\nSub-clause   of the  said clause use  provides that  the company reserves  the right  to effect the sale  of  Sodium Hydrosulphite to anybody and anywhere in India direct.\nUnder clause use use  4, the  price which the distributor would be entitled  to charge to the consumer was  fixed  by  the company and  it was  provided that the distributor will sell the materials  to the clause ents or consumers at the said price plus certain  costs incurred  by the  distributor.\nclause use ase  6 provides that the said company would grant the distributor a rebate of  3% on  the ex-factory  selling price,  which  the company was  entitled to determine as aforesaid.\nThis rebate was liable  to be paid to the distributor only at the end of the month  when  the  statement  of  the  account  would  be settled.\nUnder clause use use 7,  the distributor  was  liable  to guarantee the minimum off take of the said product.\nclause use use 8 of the agreement  provides  for  mode of  payment  by  the assessee (distributor) to the said company, and very briefly stated, it  provides that  the assessee  would arrange  for effecting payment  either in cash or by Demand draft payable at par,  or, alternatively, would open an irrevocable letter of credit  in favour  of the said company negotiable against R/R or other documents of despatch of goods.\nIt is provided that the  letter of credit would cover the value of goods as well as  charges of  transport for  booking  the  goods  to destination station,  Sales tax and other expenses including cost of  insurance, if any, effected  at the  distributor's request.\nAn  alternative mode  of the payment is provided to the effect  that the  assessee as distributor must remit 10% of the full value  by Demand Draft and retire the documents of despatch  of goods  sent to the assessee through bank for collection from  the bank.\nclause use use 8 further provides if the documents sent by the said company  are not retired within the stipulated time,  interest  would be  payable  by  the distributor on the amount due at the rate of 12% per annum.\nThe clause use  also makes it clause ar  that if the second mode of payment is  adopted by the assessee,  consignments would be insured by  the said  company against  transit risk  and the insurance charges would have to be borne by the assessee.\nIt may be noted at this stage that the Tribunal has found as a fact that in respect of the said transactions 883 from  1st  September,  1967  to  20th  December,  1968,  the invoices were  prepared by  the said company in the names of the consumers  of goods  and the goods were consigned to the destinations through  public  carriers booked self.\nThe transport bills  were endorsed and handed  over by the said company to  the assessee.\nFrom 20th  December, 1968,  goods were consigned to the destination showing  the assessee as consignor.\nBut we are not concerned  with the  period from 20th December, 1968.\nIn  the assessment of the assessee for the period  1967-68 under  the Kerala General Sales Tax Act, 1963, the  final assessment  was initially completed on 27th September, 1968  and a turnover of rupees 70,952.61 as reported by the assessee was  accepted and tax levied on that basis.\nThereafter, it was alleged  by the Assessing Authority that the transactions  in the  aforesaid period,  which had taken place in  the manner  set  out earlier,  had  been  wrongly excluded from  the turnover  reported by the assessee in the return and  hence that turnover has escaped assessment.\nThe contention of  the assessee  that these transactions did not constitute sales by the said company to the assessee was not accepted and hence it was held by the Assessing Officer that the said  turnover was liable to be included in the taxable turnover of  the assessee,  as escaped turnover.\nAn  appeal preferred  by the  assessee  to  the Appellant  Assistant Commissioner was  dismissed.\nIn  a  Second  Appeal  to  the Tribunal, the  Tribunal took the view, by majority, that the aforesaid transactions had taken place directly between the said company  and the  consumers and the assessee was merely an agent  of the  company in  respect thereof.\nThe Tribunal allowed the  appeal and  directed the aforesaid transactions to be excluded from the taxable turnover of the assessee.\nOn a revision  to the  High Court under Section 41 of the said Act, the Division Bench of the High Court took the view that the Tribunal  was wrong in coming to the conclusion that the assessee was  acting only  as an  Agent in  respect  of  the aforesaid transactions between the  said  company  and  the consumers and allowed the Revision Application.\nThe Division Bench of the High Court considered several cases which  were cited  before the  Division Bench and held that the test to determine whether there is a sale or not is to find  out whether  there  is  transfer  of  property.\nIt further pointed out that the question whether there has been transfer  of   property  must  necessarily  depend  upon  an appreciation of  the rights  and obligations  of the parties under the  contract.\nIf  the property is transferred, unless there is a specific stipulation to the contrary, any risk of loss or injury to the goods would, thereafter, be not in the seller but  in the  buyer.\nThey further pointed out that the delivery may be either to the distributor himself or to his 884 nominee\n the  nominee could  be the  person whose orders are booked by  the distributor.\nThey pointed  out that  in  the present case even when the goods were despatched by the said company to  the address  of the customers, whose orders were booked by   the  distributor, namely,  the  assessee,  the documents of  title were not delivered to the customers, but handed over  to the  distributor on receipt of price, or the documents  of title  were   endorsed in   favour  of  the distributor and sent through the banks to be honoured by the distributor by payment.\nIn such cases, where there was some time-lag between  the despatch of goods and the entrustment of documents of title on receiving payment through the bank, care was  taken to  stipulate that the risk would be covered by insurance  which would be at the cost of the distributor.\nThe Division  Bench further  pointed out  that in  the said agreement, the distributor had  not  been  referred  to  as Agent  but   as  Distributor  and  that  this  was also significant although  not conclusive.\nIt was on the basis of these conclusions  that the High Court reversed the decision of the Tribunal and allowed the Revision Application.\nIn our  opinion, since  both the parties have proceeded on the footing  that  the  transactions  in  question were effected pursuant to the said agreement, the primary task to which we  must address ourselves is to examine whether under the agreement  the assessee  firm was  an agent  of the said company, or whether the assessee firm was really a purchaser of the goods which  were booked by it.\nIn this connections, it must  be noticed  that under  sub-clause   of clause use use 2 provides that  the distributor has the right of the sale of the product  within the  stipulated area.\nBulk supplies were effected in  waggon-load or  lorry-load by  the said company direct to   the  consumer,   but  only  provided  that  the distributor arranged  the payment  as per  the agreement and also took  the responsibility to bear entirely the resultant effects and  risk from said direct  despatches.\nIt  is true that the  price at  which the  goods were  to be sold to the customers was  fixed by the company but that itself does not necessarily lead  to the  conclusion that the assessee acted merely as  an agent of the said company.\nIn fact, it is well settled that  the mere fact that the manufacturer fixes the sale price,  by itself,  cannot lead  to the conclusion that the distributor  is merely  an agent.\nIt is significant that under the agreement what the distributor got is described as a rebate  and not  as commission,  as one would normally expect in  an agreement of agency.\nThis is a factor which is by no  means conclusive,  but to a certain extent indicative of  the  relationship  between the  said  company  and  the assessee.\nWhat is most  important  is,  however,  that  the supplies were made to the distributor against payment either immediate or deferred as provided in the agreement, and even when 885 the goods were destined directly to the customer, it was the distributor   who had  to guarantee  to arrange the payment.\nclause use use 8  makes it  quite clause ar  that  the  arrangement  for effecting payment  had to  be made by the distributor either in case  of by demand draft  or by  irrevocable  letter  of credit in  the company's  favour negotiable  against R/R  or other documents of despatch of goods.\nIt is also significant that where  there was  some time  lag between the sending of the goods  and the  payment, the goods were to be insured at the cost of the assessee.\nThis circumstance, in our opinion, clause arly shows  that in respect of the goods dispatched under orders placed  by the  distributors, the distributors really acted as  purchasers of the goods which they in turn sold to the customers  and did not merely act as agents of the said company.\nIn  respect of  the goods  in question  which were despatched through  public carriers,  although the  invoices were prepared  in the  names of  the consumers of the goods, and the  goods were  consigned to  the destination  through public carrier booked to  self, as  pointed by the Tribunal and the bills were endorsed and handed over to the assessee.\nWhen  considered  in  the  light  of  the  agreement,  these circumstances  clause arly  shows that  in  respect  of  these transactions the  property in the goods dispatched passed to the distributor  on the bills being endorsed and handed over to the distributors.\nOur attention  was drawn  by Shri Krishnamurthy  Iyer, learned counsel for the assessee (appellant) to the decision of this  Court in  The Bhopal Sugar Industries Ltd. v. Sales Tax Officer,  Bhopal, [1977]  3  S.C.C.\np.  147  where  the question was whether the contract was one of agency or sale.\nThis Court held that the question will have to be determined having regard  to the  terms and  recitals of the agreement, the intention  of the  parties as  may be spelt out from the terms of  the document and the surrounding circumstances and having regard to the course of dealings between the parties.\nWhile interpreting the terms of the agreement, the Court has to look  to the  substance rather  than the  form of it.\nThe mere fact  that the  word 'agent' or 'agency' is used or the words 'buyer' and seller' are used to describe the status of the parties  concerned is  not sufficient  to  lead  to  the irresistible inference that the  parties did in fact intend that the  said status would be conferred.\nWe are in complete agreement with the principles laid down in this decision.\nWe may point out that although we have referred to the assessee being described in the agreement as distributor and not as agent and  to the fact that what they got was described as rebate and  not commission,  we have  not treated  these circumstances as  in  any  manner  decisive.\nIn  our  view, however, these descriptions considered  in the light of the general tenor of the agreement and the 886 circumstances  surrounding   the  transactions between  the parties show  that the assessee was not agent, but really a purchaser from the company  in  respect  of  the  goods  in question.\nLearned  counsel for  the  appellant  also  drew  our attention to  a passage  in Pollack  &amp\n Mulla's Commentary on the Sale of Goods and Partnership Acts, (4th Edition at page   114) where  the learned authors have cited with approval the statement of Lord Justice Cotton to the effect that when the vendor on  shipment takes  the bill  of lading to  his  own order, he  has the  power of  absolutely  disposing  of  the cargo, and may prevent the purchaser from ever asserting any right of property therein.\nLord Justice Cotton observed that in such  cases the  purchaser had  no property in the goods, though he had offered to accept bills or had paid the price.\nThese  observations,   however,  in   our  view,   have   no application to the case  before us,  because  in  the case before us,  although the  goods were  consigned to the self, the documents  relating to the despatch of goods, namely R/R or other  documents of title were endorsed in favour of the assessees and handed over to them on payment or were sent to the assessees through the bank for collection.\nWe may mention that it was urged by learned counsel for the  respondent,in  the  alternative,  that,  although subsection 21  of Section 2 of the Kerala General Sales Tax Act defines sale  in a  manner similar  to the definition of the said term under the Sale of Goods Act, Explanation 5 to subsection 21  of Section 2 provides that two independent sales or purchases  shall, for the purposes of that Act, be deemed to have  taken place  in the  circumstances set  out in that explanation.\nA perusal of  the said  explanation shows that such independent  sales or purchases take place, inter-alia, where the  goods are  transferred from a principal  to  his selling agent  and from  the selling agent to the purchaser.\nIt was submitted by  him that in view of this explanation, even ifthe  appellant firm  was merely the agent of the said company in  respect of the transactions  in question, there were two  sales which  must be deemed to have taken place in respect of  each of the transactions for the purposes of the said Act\n one from the said company to the appellant and the other from  the appellant  to the  respective consumer\n  and that the  sale from  the said  company to  the appellant was liable to  be  included  in  the  taxable  turnover  of  the assessce.In ourview,  it is  not necessary  to consider this submission, because,  according to  us, in  view of the said agreement,  considered in  the  light of  the  surrounding circumstances, the  assesseeas distributor  was not an agent of the said  company  in  respect  of the  transaction  in question, but was the pur  887 chaser and hence the transactions were liable to be included in the turnover of the assessee.\nIn the  result, we  find that  there is no merit in the appeal and the appeal must stand dismissed with costs.\nThere will be an order accordingly."}}
